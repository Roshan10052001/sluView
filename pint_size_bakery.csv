Upon arriving, I noticed how cute the inside was before even entering. There is a parking lot on the side of the building, and on the street as well. Once you enter the inside, the smell of fresh baked goods hit you in the nose. They have a display case with all of the bakery items they have for sell. You can look straight ahead and see the kitchen area and staff making fresh goods. 

Staff were friendly and attentive, and made recommendations on items to try. 

I ordered an iced vanilla latte, a butter pecan cookie and a vanilla butter pecan cupcake. The vanilla latte was smooth, creamy and not too sweet. Their syrups are house made. The butter pecan cookie tasted exactly like butter pecan ice cream. It was soft and chewy, with a hint of salt on top to taste, and had a pecan placed on top. That was probably one of the best butter pecan cookies I've ever had. (Perfect cookie for the fall)"

So many interesting and tasty items to be had. If you're planning on going on a Saturday, you may want to show up when they open or wait until after 10 as they can get a bit of a line. The service is prompt and pleasant. It's a very small place with not a whole lot of room in it so you may want to look at their offerings online if you're not sure what you're interested in trying. I would highly recommend Pint Size for sweets and savory items"

This bakery may be small, but it's mighty. Its the perfect
place to run in and grab little goodies for friends. Smelled amazing inside! Super friendly staff too. 

They update their flavors very regularly on social media, and I enjoy that touch of having new things every few days! 

For a few days they featured blueberry pancake scones... and they were the best I ever had. They were buttery, flavorful, and ridiculously delicious. The blondie perfectly executed the beautiful snickerdoodle flavor. They blew my expectations out of the water! I will certainly be revisiting this bakery to try the ever changing menu."

You can't go wrong with anything on their menu but their oatmeal cookies sammie is my ""Can't Miss"" item!"

The bakery's take on a kouign-amann with its crisp, flaky layers of rich buttery dough and caramelized sugar is heavenly. The perfect treat to enjoy alongside a latte (bonus: they serve Kaldi's coffee and boast yummy housemade syrups!). The bakery itself is a cute little shop (albeit with little to no indoor seating) and service is always quick and friendly."

The lady working the front was nice and helpful with recommendations. I ended up getting all 5 cupcakes and I have to say they were amazing and true to her word it last a couple of days in the fridge. I'd say the icing is so well done and compliments the moist cupcakes. Good job guys and I hope to try new flavors when they come out!!

I'm going to a family get together and was instructed to bring dessert. I didn't think I'd get my hands on a full pie/ cake upon arrival, I know those are popular and/ or take an order ahead effort (may or may not have dropped the ball lol). I figured their cookies would be a great addition, and to my pleasant surprise they had cookie boxes set up and ready to rock and roll. It was my lucky day. 
Also going to a small get together tonight and picked up a few items to bring to that as well. They have coffee, which is great since I hadn't had any yet this morning. Staff was kind and helpful, per usual. 
Thanks for saving the day, Pint Sized!"

They always have new items to try, along with the regular, delicious favorites. The hardest part about going there is deciding what to choose, but the staff is always cheerful and helpful. Although the business changed owners in July, the quality of the products and the vibe of the place seem to have remained unchanged."

It's one of our favorites in the city and there is literally nothing here that is bad--you can't go wrong with any choice, be it coffee drinks, desserts, or breakfast. Salted caramel croissants (kouign amann) are a Saturday specialty and WELL WORTH the trip. I also am particularly fond of the oatmeal cream pies which are chewy and sweet with just enough salt to make it interesting and a marshmallow buttercream in the center. The quiche is also to die for, I could eat just the crust for days! Check this one out, you won't be disappointed."
